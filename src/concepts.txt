lifting state up
props drilling
can we make index.js as a component or is not possible as some default app naming conventions?
modules--state
even mstp is arbitrary and only thing we need is -----------connect function and what we are passing and returning there-------- 
what is augument --CounterConnector

arbitrary argument has entire state of that app / whole pie itself ---mapStateToProps--
